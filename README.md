WIP: currently testing 3 different methods of graph generation in these files: 
1. graph_generator_v1
2. graph_generator_v2
3. nltk_kmeans_cluster: seems to be the least effective

## dependencies?

https://github.com/vasturiano/react-force-graph

## Dev guide: 
1. Set up Python virtual environment. 
2. Install dependencies in requirements.txt. 
3. First run flask backend: 'cd text_processing' --> 'python3 -B app.py'
